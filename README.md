# Obesity Trends in High-School kids in the United States 




## Research Question
How have obesity levels among U.S. high school students (grades 9–12) varied across time, and how do these levels differ by sex, state, and race/ethnicity?


## Objective

This milestone focused on leveraging Python to analyze and visualize data to answer specific research questions.

The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of:

- Data Retrieval and cleaning

- Data analysis

- Data visualization

The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in Python and conduct independent, insightful research.

## Research Topic

This research analyzes trends and disparities in obesity rates among U.S. high school students by sex, state, and race/ethnicity using CDC YRBSS data.


## Data Retrieval and Preparation

Data was extracted from the CDC YRBSS dataset via API request to https://data.cdc.gov/resource/vba9-s8jp.json. The raw JSON was cleaned by handling missing values, filtering records relevant to the teen obesity research analysis (e.g., by topic, stratification for sex/race/state, and grades 9–12), and saved as a processed CSV for visualization and modeling.

## Deliverable

A Jupyter Notebook was created to showcase:

- Data retrieval and cleaning

- Analytical Insights

- Visualizations (bar chart, line graph, and pie chart)

## Key Findings
- The analysis compares obesity prevalence among high-school students across racial/ethnic groups (e.g., non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian) using YRBSS data stratified by race/ethnicity for national “Total” high-schoolers. It examines both the level and trend over time, showing that Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black students consistently have higher obesity rates than non-Hispanic White students, while Asian students have the lowest rates, highlighting substantial disparities.

- The male high-school students consistently have higher obesity rates than female students in the same years, indicating a persistent gender gap in adolescent obesity.

- Southern states such as Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Alabama have some of the highest average obesity proportions.
